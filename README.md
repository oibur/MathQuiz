# MathQuiz

Little math quiz I made on a long drive.

User continues to get +, -, * or / questions until an incorrect answer is given
Current score is printed after each correct answer given 
A final score is printed out at the 

In hindsight I should have incorporated a try/except for each 'int(input(question_to_be_answered))'

Some ideas for future additions include:
-Exploring the math package to see if this could have been written easier
-Include a timer aspect that either gives 10s per question or keeps track of total time
-Write results to a file to keep a running log of high scores - maybe have user enter name at end to go with score
